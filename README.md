# Advent of Code 2022 - A swift newbie approach

My collection of source code to solve the [2022 Advent of code challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in Swift. 
I am completely new to the language, which might explain why I probabaly found the most complicated way to solve the puzzles. 

## Used tooling

I am working with XCode Sandboxes to track the puzzles. There is one Sandbof file per day. These Sandbox files are mapped to a specific folder named by day and also contain the input files. 

## Easier navigation
